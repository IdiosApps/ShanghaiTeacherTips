## The dangers of sliding whiteboards
One of my schools has a smart TV (great!) with front-facing USB ports. I have my USB stick attached to my keys, and the extra little distance meant that caused a board to snag when I slide it towards the screen. 
I'd either advise keeping USB sticks separate from keychains (though that makes them easy to lose), or removing them from the smart screen once your PPT has loaded. To make up for potentially having to reinsert your USB in a class, you can make shortcuts to your relevant lessons in the main directory of the USB - so you have fast access to your PPTs (whilst maintaining your file structure of choice).
