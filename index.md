## The dangers of sliding whiteboards
One of my schools has a smart TV (great!) with front-facing USB ports. I have my USB stick attached to my keys, and the extra little distance meant that caused a board to snag when I slide it towards the screen. 
I'd either advise keeping USB sticks separate from keychains (though that makes them easy to lose), or removing them from the smart screen once your PPT has loaded. To make up for potentially having to reinsert your USB in a class, you can make shortcuts to your relevant lessons in the main directory of the USB - so you have fast access to your PPTs (whilst maintaining your file structure of choice).

"British citizens living abroad
You can register as an overseas voter for up to 15 years after leaving the UK, as long as:

*you’re a British citizen
*you were registered to vote in the UK within the previous 15 years (or, in some cases, if you were too young to have registered when you left the UK)
Just register to vote in the normal way. You’ll need to renew your registration every year."
